	abstract = {As data centers become more and more central in Internet communications, both research and operations communities have begun to explore how to better design and manage them. In this paper, we present a preliminary empirical study of end-to-end traﬃc patterns in data center networks that can inform and help evaluate research and operational approaches. We analyze SNMP logs collected at 19 data centers to examine temporal and spatial variations in link loads and losses. We ﬁnd that while links in the core are heavily utilized the ones closer to the edge observe a greater degree of loss. We then study packet traces collected at a small number of switches in one data center and ﬁnd evidence of ON-OFF traﬃc behavior. Finally, we develop a framework that derives ON-OFF traﬃc parameters for data center trafﬁc sources that best explain the SNMP data collected for the data center. We show that the framework can be used to evaluate data center traﬃc engineering approaches. We are also applying the framework to design network-level traﬃc generators for data centers.},

	abstract = {Hybrid computing platforms, comprising CPU cores and FPGA logic, are increasingly used for accelerating data-intensive workloads in cloud deployments, and are a growing topic of interest in systems research. However, from a research perspective, existing hardware platforms are limited: they are often optimized for concrete, narrow use-cases and, therefore lack the flexibility needed to explore other applications and configurations. We show that a research group can design and build a more general, open, and affordable hardware platform for hybrid systems research. The platform, Enzian, is capable of duplicating the functionality of existing CPU/FPGA systems with comparable performance but in an open, flexible system. It couples a large FPGA with a server-class CPU in an asymmetric cache-coherent NUMA system. Enzian also enables research not possible with existing hybrid platforms, through explicit access to coherence messages, extensive thermal and power instrumentation, and an open, programmable baseboard management processor.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17351},
	abstract = {The end of Moore’s Law and the tightening performance requirements in today’s clouds make re-architecting the software stack a necessity. To address this, cloud providers and vendors offload the virtualization control plane and data plane, along with the host OS data plane, to IPUs (SmartNICs), recovering scarce host resources that are then used by applications. However, the host OS control plane–encompassing kernel thread scheduling, memory management, the network stack, file systems, and more–is left on the host CPU and degrades workload performance. This paper presents Wave, a split OS architecture that moves OS subsystem policies to the IPU while keeping OS mechanisms on the host CPU. Wave not only frees host CPU resources, but it reduces host workload interference and leverages network insights on the IPU to improve policy decisions. Wave makes OS control plane offloading practical despite high host-IPU communication latency, lack of a coherent interconnect, and operation across two system images. We present Wave’s design and implementation, and implement several OS subsystems in Wave, including kernel thread scheduling, the control plane for a network stack, and memory management. We then evaluate the Wave subsystems on Stubby (scheduling and network), our GCE VM service (scheduling), and RocksDB (memory management and scheduling). We demonstrate that Wave subsystems are competitive with and often superior to on-host subsystems, saving 8 host CPUs for Stubby, 16 host CPUs for database memory management, and improving VM performance by up to 11.2\%.},

Traditional kernel-based operating systems impose an unaffordable overhead, so recent kernel-bypass OSes [73] and libraries [23] eliminate the OS kernel from the I/O datapath. However, none of these systems offer a general-purpose datapath OS replacement that meet the needs of µs-scale systems. This paper proposes Demikernel, a flexible datapath OS and architecture designed for heterogenous kernel-bypass devices and µs-scale datacenter systems. We build two prototype Demikernel OSes and show that minimal effort is needed to port existing µs-scale systems. Once ported, Demikernel lets applications run across heterogenous kernel-bypass devices with ns-scale overheads and no code changes.},

We use this data to build HyperProtoBench, an open-source benchmark representative of key serialization-framework user services at scale. In doing so, we identify key insights that challenge prevailing assumptions about serialization framework usage.},

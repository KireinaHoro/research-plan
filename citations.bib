	abstract = {As data centers become more and more central in Internet communications, both research and operations communities have begun to explore how to better design and manage them. In this paper, we present a preliminary empirical study of end-to-end traﬃc patterns in data center networks that can inform and help evaluate research and operational approaches. We analyze SNMP logs collected at 19 data centers to examine temporal and spatial variations in link loads and losses. We ﬁnd that while links in the core are heavily utilized the ones closer to the edge observe a greater degree of loss. We then study packet traces collected at a small number of switches in one data center and ﬁnd evidence of ON-OFF traﬃc behavior. Finally, we develop a framework that derives ON-OFF traﬃc parameters for data center trafﬁc sources that best explain the SNMP data collected for the data center. We show that the framework can be used to evaluate data center traﬃc engineering approaches. We are also applying the framework to design network-level traﬃc generators for data centers.},

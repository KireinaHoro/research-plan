# Doctoral Plan

Written in Typst; a crash course on how to write in the language is
[here](https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/writing-in-typst/).  Install [the
compiler](https://github.com/typst/typst) by downloading a [binary
release](https://github.com/typst/typst/releases/), or with `cargo`:

```console
$ cargo install --locked typst-cli
```

Launch the interactive watch session to automatically compile based on file change:

```console
$ typst watch main.typ

watching main.typ
writing to main.pdf
